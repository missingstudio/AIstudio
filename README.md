Let's make a chat completion request to OpenAI through the AI Gateway using both REST and gRPC protocols

### Send a request using curl
```sh
curl \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "x-ms-provider: openai" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {{OPENAI_API_KEY}}" \
--data '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"who are you?"}]}' \
http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions
```

### Send a request using grpcurl

```sh
grpcurl \
-d '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}' \
-H 'x-ms-provider: openai' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{OPENAI_API_KEY}}' \
-plaintext  localhost:8080  llm.v1.LLMService.ChatCompletions
```
