        After running studio gateway, you can call api using `curl` in your terminal by running:

        ```bash
        curl \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "x-ms-provider: openai" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer {{OPENAI_API_KEY}}" \
        --data '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"who are you?"}]}' \
        http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions
        ```
